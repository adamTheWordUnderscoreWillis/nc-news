# Welcome to the Adam Willis Cool News Web App

If you're surfing the web and you fancy hanging ten to see some cool news... give this link a click:

[AdamWillisCoolNews Official Website](https://adamwilliscoolnews.netlify.app/)

## What is the app

Apart from being a hub for everything hip and happening... it is also a news app for posting comments on articles, voting up the coolest stories and finding articles related to your interests (So long as those interests are either cooking, football or coding).

This project uses react to deliver axios requests that interact with my [back end Api](https://github.com/adamTheWordUnderscoreWillis/Willis-news-project) which in turn retrieves and mutates the information inside a database.

## Runnning the project Locally

#### Minimum Dependencies

Node v21.7.1

#### Set up 

1. Navigate to the folder you want cool news to live in (it's really none of my business where you put it) and run the follwing command in your terminal:

     >git clone https://github.com/adamTheWordUnderscoreWillis/nc-news.git
2. Now that the project is on your machine you'll want to install the dependeies (Make sure node is up to date).
    >npm install

3. To view the website in a browser you will need to use vite, which should have been installed with your dependnecies:
    >npm run dev

4. Now you can copy the url you seeinto your browser or potentially you can enter the following command

    >--host
5. You should now have a working version of the website in your browser and be eagerly looking through some incredibly cool news.

Clear instructions on how to run your project locally, e.g. git clone <repo-url>, cd..., etc.
